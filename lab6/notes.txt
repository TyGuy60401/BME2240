Using Python, 
1 - write a script using np.linalg commands to deliver the solution to your matrix
    equation by determining the inverse of the coefficient matrix and multiplying the solution vector
(as shown in the introduction). Compare your numerical solutions for I1, I2, and I3 to your
measurements.
